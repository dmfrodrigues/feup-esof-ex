- b) On the 80s, using critical service analysis
- c) On the 40s, manually
- d) On the 90s, using automated testing.

**Answer:** ?

#### Question 2
Which one of the following is most adequate to have a software prototype (please justify your answer):
- a) A customer-driven app for ordering food;
- b) A business-to-business software for supporting a supply chain;
- c) A healthcare software to handle critical data;
- d) All of the above

#### Question 3
With RUP, the construction phase is when the actual software is most actively developed. Identify the disciplines that are most active during this phase and briefly explain why.
- a) All disciplines are equally active;
- b) The only active discipline is the implementation;
- c) Implementation and testing;
- d) Design, implementation and testing.

#### Question 4
XP actively prevent software regressions by motivating a test first approach. Who should participate in this process? Justify your choice.
- a) The client should provide the development team with tests for his requirements;
- b) The client and the project manager should write tests before tackling new features;
- c) The development team, with input from the client, should write tests before tackling new features;
- d) The development team, with input from the project manager, should write tests before tackling new features;

#### Question 5
Missing project deadlines is possibly the most recurring failure in software development. How does Scrum try to address it? Justify your answer.
- a) Scrum will only ensure that a product increment exists in the end of each sprint, but not the quantity of features that are part of it. Traditional methodologies are more strict hence, more capable of meeting deadlines;
- b) The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring that the team is efficient and delivers the software at the right time;
- c) Effort estimations and velocity can be used to forecast when the backlog will be complete;
- d) A well defined process will ensure development efficiency, which will guarantee the project deadline.

- b) Represent critical behavior
- c) Represent mandatory behavior
- d) Represent behavior imported from other system

#### Question 8

What technique/approach is typically adopted to share such knowledge between engineers? Describe why is it a good technique/approach.
- a) Object Oriented Programming.
- b) Reusable Open Source libraries.
- c) Design Patterns.
- d) Sequence Diagrams.

- c) 5
- d) 3

#### Question 10
