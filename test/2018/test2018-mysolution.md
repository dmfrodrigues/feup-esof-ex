#### Question 31

**Q:** Briefly describe a famous software failure, its causes, consequences and lessons learned.

**A:** A famous software failure was related to the Therac-25, caused by a software error, more specifically a race condition. Because of it, huge amounts of radiation were emited onto pacients, and at least 5 died as a result. In this specific problem, a main issue was the developers' over-confidence since they didn't properly test the device's features. So, a lesson to be learned, besides being humble, is to always test the project before launching an executable iteration, by using a complete test suite of for example, unit, integration, and/or system tests.
